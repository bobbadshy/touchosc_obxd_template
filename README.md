# TouchOSC template for the OB-Xd Virtual Analog Synthesizer

[TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc/) template for the
[Oberheim OB-Xd Virtual Analog Synthesizer](https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/) (and
possibly other Oberheim OB-X/OB-Xa software emulations).

The layout and functionality of this template were created using OB-Xd versions
3.5.3 through 3.6.

## Supported features

- All controls of the OB-Xd virtual synth have been implemented. The control
  layout closely follows the OB-Xd "IIkka Rosma Dark" default skin.
- All MIDI mappings match the default mappings found in OB-Xd v3.6. So all
  controls should work out of the box, with no further setup neccessary.

  The template also contains a MIDI mappings XML file for OB-Xd. If some MIDI
  mappings do not work as expected (OB-Xd versions below 3.6), try to copy:
  
  [./midi_mapping/TouchOsc.xml](./midi_mapping/TouchOsc.xml)
  
  from this template's directory into your `discoDSP` documents folder:
  
  ... `discoDSP/OB-Xd 3/MIDI/TouchOsc.xml`
  
  *This folder is located in the "Documents" folder in your user's `$HOME`
  directory. The exact naming will differ between operating systems and
  distributions. Consult the discoDSP documentation if you are unsure about the
  folder location.*

  Restart OB-Xd. The MIDI menu should now show **"TouchOsc"** as a new MIDI mappings
  option.

- All TouchOSC faders use a 

double-tap controls
zoom 
tooltip and true value

Currently ***work in progress***. I'll add some detailed infos soon..

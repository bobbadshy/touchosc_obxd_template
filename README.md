# touchosc_obxd_template
[TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc/) template for the [Oberheim OB-Xd Virtual Analog Synthesizer](https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/) (and possibly other Oberheim OB-Xa software emulations).

Currently work in progress. I'll add some decent info and a Release once I've reached the first beta ;)
